- Every issue detected by AI is assigned a **Severity Score** (Low, Medium, High, Critical).  
- Founders **earn "Resolution Points"** when problems arise, proportional to the severity.  
- These points are spent to **deploy fixes**, calling AI models, upgrading infrastructure, or adjusting policies.  
- **Ensures autonomy** while allowing founders to intervene in critical moments.  

**Example:**  
- A smart contract has an exploit (**Critical Severity**).  
- Founder receives **100 Resolution Points**.  
- **80 Points** are spent to deploy an AI security patch.  
- The remaining points can be saved for future issues.
